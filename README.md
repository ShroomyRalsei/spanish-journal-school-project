# spanish-newspaper-school-project
This is my final project for my first 12th grade semester. This project will be mimicking a real newspaper webpage (on the front end side of things).

This project uses Listin Diario (https://listindiario.com/) as a reference for its layout, and also uses text and images from multiple sources and web articles.

The list of sources that were used for this project can be found in the following document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lYjXIDPFBEjU0kxtx6wmQVTs5M090qV3wGiZ9sDXIsE/edit

The script file contains two functions. randomNumberGenerator picks a random number and sets the randomNumber variable's value to it, while createRandomAd runs the aforementioned function first and then, based on the value of the random number, it'll randomly pick one of five ads.
